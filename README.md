Centurion
=========

A clean cut UI theme for Sublime Text 2. Bastardised from the source code of [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/) 

Centurion was made out of a want for less UI and more code. It's so minimal you can barely see it. 
No gradients, no 1px edges and not a thousand different icon sprites. Just color, shape and 14 [icons](http://www.glyphicons.com/).

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clone it or download into your packages directory.
Make sure that it resides in a folder called `Theme - Centurion` 
Unless of course you feel like experiencing the wrath of none icons. 

Then press `super+,` to access your `Settings - User` and insert: 
        
        "theme": "Centurion.sublime-theme"

If it looks like crap make sure to restart Sublime before crying.
