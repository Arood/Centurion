Centurion reforked for Super Zen
=========

This is a modified version of [Centurion](https://github.com/allanhortle/Centurion) made by [Allan Hortle](https://github.com/allanhortle).
The changes was made to fit my theme [Super Zen](http://marcusolovsson.com/super-zen/) ([Github-link](https://github.com/Arood/Super-Zen))

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clone it into your packages directory. These are OSX paths because I'm lazy like that. For Windows/Other just substitute your paths like a boss.

    cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages

    git clone git://github.com/Arood/Centurion.git 'Theme - Centurion'
       
Make sure you have the `Theme - Centurion` at the end of the command so it is placed in the correct folder.  
Unless of course you feel like experiencing the wrath of none icons. 

Back to Sublime Text, press `super+,` to access your `Settings - User` and insert: 
        
    "theme": "Centurion.sublime-theme"

If it looks like crap make sure to restart Sublime before crying.
